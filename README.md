## 🚀 **Getting Started (Your First Steps with GitHub)**

If you're new to GitHub and want to learn by working with this project, follow these beginner-friendly steps:

### **Step 1: Understanding GitHub**
- **Repository (repo)**: A project folder stored on GitHub containing all the code and files
- **Clone**: Download a copy of the repository to your computer
- **Commit**: Save your changes with a description of what you did
- **Push**: Upload your changes back to GitHub

### **Step 2: Clone This Repository**
```bash
# First, install Git on your computer if you haven't already
# Then open your terminal/command prompt and run:

git clone https://github.com/firstprinciplescg/Claude-Code-Guide-for-Beginners.git
cd Claude-Code-Guide-for-Beginners
```

**What this does:** Downloads all the project files to your computer so you can work with them.

### **Step 3: Set Up the Development Environment**
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies (the tools this project needs)
npm install

# Start the development server (launches the website locally)
npm run dev
```

**What this does:** 
- `npm install` downloads all the tools and libraries this project uses
- `npm run dev` starts a local web server so you can see the website at `http://localhost:5173`

### **Step 4: Make Your First Changes**
1. Open the project in your favorite text editor (VS Code recommended)
2. Try changing some text in `src/sections/Introduction.jsx`
3. Save the file and watch your browser automatically update!

### **Step 5: Your First Commit (Saving Your Work)**
```bash
# Check what files you've changed
git status

# Add your changes to be committed
git add .

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Update introduction text to personalize the guide

- Changed welcome message to include my name
- Updated example to reflect my learning goals
- This commit shows I successfully set up the development environment"

# Upload your changes to GitHub (if you have push access)
git push origin main
```

**Understanding Commit Messages:**
- **First line**: Short summary (50 characters or less)
- **Blank line**: Separates summary from detailed explanation
- **Body**: Explain what you changed and why (optional but helpful)
- **Good practice**: Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
