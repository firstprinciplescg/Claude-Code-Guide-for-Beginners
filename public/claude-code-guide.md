## Core Concepts

### The Claude Code Interface

#### Terminal Interface
The terminal interface is your primary gateway to AI-powered development. When you launch `claude-code`, you enter an interactive session that maintains context throughout your development work. The interface supports rich text formatting, code syntax highlighting, and file previews directly in your terminal.

#### VS Code Extension
The VS Code extension brings Claude Code capabilities into your familiar development environment, providing visual diff views, clickable file references, and integrated file management without leaving your editor.

### Understanding Context

#### Tagging using @ symbol
The @ symbol serves as your primary tool for providing specific context to Claude Code:

- `@filename.py` - Include a specific file's content
- `@src/components/` - Reference an entire directory
- `@package.json` - Include dependency information
- `@utils.py:helperFunction` - Reference specific functions

#### /clear Command
Use `/clear` to reset conversation context while maintaining project awareness. This is essential when switching between different features or when conversations become too long and unfocused.

#### File Watching and Environment Access
Claude Code automatically detects changes in your codebase and can access environment variables and configuration settings that affect code suggestions.

---

## Common Workflows

### Understanding New Codebases

#### Get Codebase Overview
Start by asking Claude Code to analyze your project:
```
"Can you give me an overview of this codebase?"
```
Tag key files like `@README.md`, `@package.json`, and `@requirements.txt` for comprehensive analysis.

#### Dive into Specific Components
Use targeted @ tags to examine particular files:
```
"What does this UserAuth component do? @src/components/UserAuth/"
```

#### Find Relevant Code
Ask questions like:
```
"Where is the user registration logic implemented?"
"Show me all files related to payment processing"
```

### Building Features

#### 1. Describe the Feature
Provide detailed requirements instead of generic requests:

**❌ Poor:** "I need a login feature"

**✅ Good:** "I need a user authentication system that supports email/password login, includes password reset functionality, integrates with our existing user database, and provides JWT tokens for session management."

#### 2. Review the Plan
Claude will provide a detailed implementation plan. Ask clarifying questions:
```
"Why did you choose JWT over sessions?"
"How does this integrate with our existing error handling?"
```

#### 3. Approve Changes
Review each proposed change carefully. Claude presents changes in logical groups with diff views.

#### 4. Test the Feature
Ask Claude to create comprehensive tests:
```
"Create comprehensive tests for this authentication feature"
"Help me test all the edge cases we discussed"
```

### Fixing Bugs

#### Share Error with Claude
Provide comprehensive information:
- Complete error message and stack trace
- Relevant code snippets using @ tags
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- What you expected vs. what happened

#### Get Fix Recommendations
Claude analyzes the issue considering your entire codebase context and provides multiple solution approaches with explanations.

#### Apply the Fix
Choose your preferred approach and approve the implementation with the same review process used for new features.

## Best Practices & Pro Tips

### Be Specific: Detailed Requests Get Better Results

#### Base Request vs Improved Request Examples

**Example 1: API Integration**

❌ **Base Request:** "Help me add an API"

✅ **Improved Request:** "I need to integrate a REST API for user management that fetches user profiles from `/api/users/:id`, handles authentication with bearer tokens stored in localStorage, includes proper error handling for 401/403/500 responses, and updates the existing UserProfile component to display the fetched data with loading states."

**Example 2: Database Operations**

❌ **Base Request:** "Fix my database"

✅ **Improved Request:** "My PostgreSQL database queries are timing out when fetching user orders. The query joins three tables (users, orders, order_items) and needs to handle up to 10,000 records. I'm using Prisma ORM with Next.js. The specific query is in `@lib/database/orders.js` and the error occurs in the `getUserOrderHistory` function. I need optimization that maintains the same data structure for the frontend."

### Step-by-Step: Break Complex Tasks into Smaller Steps

#### Example: E-commerce Checkout System

**❌ Large Task:** "Build a complete checkout system for our e-commerce site"

**✅ Broken into Smaller Steps:**
1. Create shopping cart state management with add/remove/update quantity functions
2. Build cart display component with item details and price calculations
3. Implement shipping address form with validation and address lookup
4. Add payment method selection (credit card, PayPal, etc.)
5. Create order summary component with tax and shipping calculations
6. Integrate payment processing with Stripe API
7. Build order confirmation page and email notifications

### Let Claude Explore: Allow Codebase Exploration First

Before starting work on complex features, prompt Claude to explore:

```
"Before we start working on the user notification system, can you explore the codebase to understand how we currently handle user communications, what technologies we're using for messaging, and what patterns we follow for user-facing features? Please examine @src/, @package.json, and any files related to email, notifications, or user communication."
```

### Terminal UI Tips

#### Essential Commands:
1. `claude-code --help` - Display comprehensive help
2. `claude-code --version` - Check current version
3. `claude-code init` - Initialize project
4. `claude-code --config` - Access configuration
5. `claude-code --verbose` - Enable detailed logging
6. `ctrl + c` - Gracefully interrupt operations
7. `/save [filename]` - Save conversation
8. `/load [filename]` - Load previous conversation
9. `/export` - Export changes and history
10. `/status` - Display session information
